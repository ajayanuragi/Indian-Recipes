    <h2>What Is Red Lentil Curry?</h2>
    <p>
      This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. It's great as a main meal rather
      than a side dish like the more traditional Indian dhal. <br />
      Don't let the ingredient list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make.
      This dish is excellent served with basmati rice.

      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and
          reduce heat to medium-low. <br />
          Cover and simmer, adding water as needed to keep lentils covered,
          until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.

          salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl; stir into onions.
          <br />
